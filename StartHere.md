Plush is a shell with a comfy user interface in a web page.

# Why we did it #

Think about this: The command shell that almost all programmers interact with, was designed over thirty years ago. The majority of the command syntax as we know it goes back 25 years. This is an interface that has stood the test of time.

In all that time, our mode of input, the keyboard, hasn't changed really changed much. Nor, for that matter, had it in the 100 years prior to the shell.

But the channel from the computer back to us, the screen, has radically altered since the Unix System 7. Then it was 80 columns by 24 lines. But since then we've had pixel-mapped displays, windows, full color, fonts, animation, rendering, compositing, etc... And we have a now ubiquitous typographic and layout engine, HTML, that enables excellent presentation of information. (As well as the horror of blink tags...)

Plush is a new shell for a modern computer: The input is still the same command line language your finger tips know how to type. The output is a web page where all the context, history, reference material, status, and data is presented in a manner that lets you get your work done, and gives you what you need when you need it.

# Status #

Plush really isn't ready for using as your shell. In fact, it's barely even ready for tinkering with. If you're itching to play with it, go ahead... but it isn't for the faint of heart... yet....
